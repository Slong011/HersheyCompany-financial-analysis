# HersheyCompany_Financial_Analysis

## Overview  
This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis of The Hershey Company. Using publicly available financial data, the analysis explores income statements, debt-to-income ratios, profitability, and overall financial health. A comparison with Nestlé is included to contextualize Hershey’s performance within the industry.

## Contents  
- **PowerPoint Presentation**: Visual summary of financial findings and key metrics  
- **Raw Financial Data**: Income statements, ratios, and supporting figures  
- **Analysis Summary**: Commentary on trends, strengths, and risks  

## Key Insights  
- **Strong Capital Structure**  
  Hershey has demonstrated responsible financial management with a notable decrease in long-term debt—from over $4 million in 2021 to $3.34 million in 2022. Their debt ratio also improved from 0.48 to 0.37, and total equity increased to $3.3 million. This points to low financial risk and a strong capacity to manage debt.

- **Investment Potential**  
  Hershey shows promising long-term investment value due to its ability to handle debt obligations and adapt to economic changes. However, short-term fluctuations in commodity costs (like cocoa) may result in volatile stock performance and a temporarily elevated P/E ratio.

- **Market Position and Strengths**  
  The company continues to operate from a position of strength due to:
  - Consistent reduction of debt
  - Efficient collections, with an average receivables period under 30 days for four consecutive years
  - Strategic focus within its niche market, avoiding overexpansion and leveraging decades of experience

- **Stock Performance**  
  Hershey appears to be in a consolidation phase, trading between $180–$200 over the past six months, with limited short-term growth.

## Tools Used  
- Microsoft PowerPoint  
- Excel for financial calculations and ratio analysis  

## Purpose  
This project was completed as part of a business/finance course and serves to demonstrate analytical thinking, financial literacy, and presentation skills. It also helps simulate real-world decision-making based on corporate financial health.
